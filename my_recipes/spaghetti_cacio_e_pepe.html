        <p> Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe is is a pasta dish from the cuisine of the city of Rome. Cacio e pepe means "cheese and pepper" in several central Italian dialects. In keeping with its name, the dish contains grated Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper, together with spaghetti, or traditionally tonnarelli. All the ingredients keep well for a long time, which made the dish practical for shepherds without fixed abode. Rough-surfaced pasta is recommended, to make the sauce adhere well.</p>
